The executives of Java Ambassadors Club have contracted your group to design and implement a standalone Club Membership Application.
Using AWT, Swing components, Java Database Connectivity and XAMPP, design and implement the application with the following details;

1. Application should allow members to create an account and register.
2. Application should allow registered members to login.
3. Create a database to hold registered members.
4. Application should ensure that no name can appear more than once using an Exception.
